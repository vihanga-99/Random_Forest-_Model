# Random_Forest-_Model
This Random Forest machine learning model is created for predicting prices for vegetables.
#Data collection
we have collected data sets from bandarawela economic centre.
#API
we have used Flask APIs to connect the model with front end

#Problem Background
Agriculture is the backbone of our countries’ economy. Out of the total population in Sri Lanka,
31.8% engages in agricultural related work. The majority of those farmers are selling their harvest
to their nearby vegetable wholesale market. But farmers are always not getting a reasonable price
for their harvest. It happens mainly because farmers have no prior knowledge about the instant
price changes in the wholesale market.
In this project, we are trying to introduce a price prediction system to farmers, so that those farmers
have a piece of knowledge about the instant price changes in wholesale markets. From that
knowledge, farmers get the prices of vegetables that can be sold in each market. With this
information, farmers can take their harvest to any wholesale market that he like and suitable, then
farmers can sell their harvest for the real price that harvest worth. 


#Language selection
After considering several programming languages available for the data science component,
Python was selected as the main programming language for the implementation of this project due
to the following factors,
• Flexible - It is an open-source language therefore its most suitable for developers who need
to prearrange applications and sites.
• Easy to learn and understand - Python's straightforwardness and meaningfulness make
Python an ideal instrument for starting software engineers. Due to its simplicity, its users
invest more energy playing with it and less time managing code.
• More support material availability and contributors - Due to the increased popularity of
python among developers hence more clients will contribute data on their client experience,
and that implies more help material is accessible at no expense.
Libraries/Frameworks selection


#Pandas

It is an open-source package in python which is widely used by professionals for machine learning
and data analysis related tasks. In this project, panda allows data importing from excel file format
and view data in a data frame.


#Pickle

The pickle module is used to serialise and deserialise the python objects. In the serialisation
process where the object is converted byte stream that can be saved on a hard drive or sent over
the internet. In the deserialization, the process byte stream can be retrieved and converted back to
the python object.


#Flask

Flask is a microframework is developed for a web application and it is written in python. It allows
you to submit data and obtain an answer in the form of a prediction. Even though there are several
web frameworks our team has decided to choose Flask due to its simplicity and ease of work. For
this project, the flask uses Werkzeug for creating software objects for functions like request,
response, and usage.


#Numpy

It is a Python library that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well
as a large lot of high mathematical functions to manage these arrays.


#Random Forest regression

Every decision tree has a large variance, but when we combine all of them in parallel, the resultant
variance is low because each decision tree is perfectly trained on that specific sample data, and
therefore the output is dependent on several decision trees rather than one. In our project, we have
implemented Random Forest Regression therefore the average of all the outputs is the final output.


#Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical
extension NumPy that runs on all platforms. As a result, it provides an open-source alternative to
MATLAB. Matplotlib's APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) can also be used to embed
plots in graphical user interfaces.


#Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is one of the most useful libraries in machine learning. Sklearn is a tool for creating
machine learning models and its regression feature is the most useful methods for our project.
